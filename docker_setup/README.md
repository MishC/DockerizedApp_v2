This docker-compose.yml works with the external images from the Docker Hub.

## External Images

  * djamka/mysql
  * djamka/todosapi 
  * djamka/nginx

## Build and Run All Containers

docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d


This will pull up all necessary containers and run them in the background.
